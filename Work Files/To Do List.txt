// TO DO LIST
===============================================================

# FIX BUGS
- sQueue throws an ObjectDisposedException, but only
  sometimes and when its drawn in the inspector 
  Have to prevent it from serializing while updating
  Maybe implement a dirty flag check?
  

# Create the asteroid settings interface
- Add asset naming and options here as well
  Just copy the uxml from the wave settings
  
  
# Create the asteroid group interface
- Fix so that I can delete button so the existing
  asteroid settings get removed properly

- Fix so that the list displays the settings for
  each asteroid inside the list?


# Create the segment interface
- Update the tab buttons to stretch like the asteroid
  settings buttons, so it adapts if I add more tabs
  
- Create the same list and button setup for the prefab
  list as well (excluding create and delete buttons)
  
- Load the visual tree for the wave and group settings
  in segment editor and clone the tree to display all of
  the properties?
  
  Problem I don't get all of the scripted logic that comes
  with it. To do that I need to separate that code into a
  smaller class that I can just create in the editor class
  
- Add a box with transparent background and a border around
  it to box in / group the wave settings together so it reads
  nicely?
  
- Display the wave and asteroid group settings underneath
  each object field button (add some extra spacing)

- Have a yellow outline around the object property field
  that shows if it is not part of this segment?


# Write about how and why I structured this tool like this
  in the readme file, and what problems and solutions I
  had during the development and what I didn't have time to
  implement before the deadline
  
  Also write that I had never utilised the new UI system
  before so this was a great exercise to start learning it
  and that I find it much more enjoyable then the old GUI
  system
  
  Remember to include git hub link and add the unity package
  file in a separate folder called ToolPackage or something?


# Create an editor for the AsteroidHandler that makes it
  easy to add a new segment to the segment queue?
  Will have to specify which folder to save it in?
  
  
# Add undo record to creating and deleting segment assets?
  https://forum.unity.com/threads/help-with-create-child-asset-undo.387708/

- Undo.RegisterCreatedObjectUndo does not remove the asset 
  from the segment but deletes the data in it

- Undo.DestroyObjectImmediate does not refresh the inspector
  nor assign it back onto the serialized property
  
- Add rename and delete asset undo as well
  Undo.DestroyObjectImmediate does not add it back to its parent
  but is just there selected but not in the inspector?
