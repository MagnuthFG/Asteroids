# FIX BUGS
- sQueue throws an ObjectDisposedException, but only
  sometimes and when its drawn in the inspector 
  Have to prevent it from serializing while updating
  Maybe implement a dirty flag check?
  
  
# Improve the interfaces
- If possible, have a yellow outline around the object
  property field that shows if it is not part of this segment?
  
- Load the visual tree for the wave and group settings
  in segment editor and the asteroid settings in the
  group editor and clone the tree to display all of the
  properties?
  
  Problem I don't get all of the scripted logic that comes
  with it. To do that I need to separate that code into a
  smaller class that I can just create in the editor class
  
  Also I have to add a show collapse button so I don't draw
  all of them and clutter up the interface
  
  Also I have to hide the asset settings and options panels
  so they aren't drawn
  
- Add a box with darker background and a border rather then
  the default content background on each element so it reads
  better?

  
# Create an editor for the AsteroidHandler that makes it
  easy to add a new segment to the segment queue?
  Will have to specify which folder to save it in?
  
  
# Add undo record to creating and deleting segment assets?
  https://forum.unity.com/threads/help-with-create-child-asset-undo.387708/

- Undo.RegisterCreatedObjectUndo does not remove the asset 
  from the segment but deletes the data in it

- Undo.DestroyObjectImmediate does not refresh the inspector
  nor assign it back onto the serialized property
  
- Add rename and delete asset undo as well
  Undo.DestroyObjectImmediate does not add it back to its parent
  but is just there selected but not in the inspector?
