# FIX BUGS
- sQueue throws an ObjectDisposedException, but only
  sometimes and when its drawn in the inspector 
  Have to prevent it from serializing while updating
  Maybe implement a dirty flag check?
  

# Create the asteroid settings interface
- Add asset naming and options here as well
  Just copy the uxml from the wave settings
  
  
# Create the asteroid group interface
- Add a button for creating a new asteroid setting
  and parents it to the asteroid group asset and
  also assigns it to the asteroid settings list

- Fix so that the list displays the settings for
  each asteroid inside the list


# Create the segment interface
- Create a content css file and add a small row space
  5px and large row space 10px style so I can add some
  spacing between rows
  
- Add a box with transparent background and a border around
  it to box in / group the wave settings together so it reads
  nicely 
  
- Display the wave and asteroid group settings underneath
  each object field button (add some extra spacing)

- Have a yellow outline around the object property field
  that shows if it is not part of this segment?


# Create an editor for the AsteroidHandler that makes it
  easy to add a new segment to the segment queue?
  Will have to specify which folder to save it in?
  
  
# Add undo record to creating and deleting segment assets?
  https://forum.unity.com/threads/help-with-create-child-asset-undo.387708/

- Undo.RegisterCreatedObjectUndo does not remove the asset 
  from the segment but deletes the data in it

- Undo.DestroyObjectImmediate does not refresh the inspector
  nor assign it back onto the serialized property
  
- Add rename and delete asset undo as well
  Undo.DestroyObjectImmediate does not add it back to its parent
  but is just there selected but not in the inspector?
