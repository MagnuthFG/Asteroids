// TO DO LIST
===============================================================

# Create a property drawer for the sQueue items
- Have the items be directly under segments drop down
  and not under items drop down
  
- Fix so I add to the _items list directly but only
  serialize if the value is not null?
  

# Continue on the AsteroidHandler
- Improve the old Asteroid script so the speed, size and
  torque is assigned in spawner not in the asteroid class
  
- Improve the spawner so that the first spawn angle
  doesn't always start at 0 but some other angle

- Add a random spawn delay between each asteroid
  Turn SpawnAsteroid into an IEnumerator
  
- Add a random wave count and duration as well

  
# Improve the look of all interfaces
- Create a AsteroidHandler editor that ???
