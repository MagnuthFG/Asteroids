# FIX BUGS
- sQueue throws an ObjectDisposedException, but only
  sometimes and when its drawn in the inspector 
  Have to prevent it from serializing while updating
  Maybe implement a dirty flag check?
  

# Create the segment interfaces
- On enable get the path to the current segment scriptable object
  or maybe its editor script? and then sub folder for the editor
  and uxml file for drawing the look of the inspector
  
- Add a tab for the wave setting and one for asteroid groups
  
- Allow to specify a an already existing wave or asteroid
  group or setting from another segment
  Have a yellow outline around the property that shows that
  it is not part of this segment?
  
- Allow to create a new wave and asteroid group and remove 
  existing via an add and remove button and parent them to
  segment
  
  Only display add button if the object field is empty
  the remove button should be to the right of the object field
  
- Display the wave and asteroid group settings underneath
  each object field


# Create an editor for the AndroidHandler that makes it easy
  to add a new segment to the segment queue
  Will have to specify which folder to save it in?
