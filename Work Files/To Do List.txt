# FIX BUGS
- sQueue throws an ObjectDisposedException, but only
  sometimes and when its drawn in the inspector 
  Have to prevent it from serializing while updating
  Maybe implement a dirty flag check?
  

# Create the segment interfaces
- Fix so the delete button deletes the assigned asset

- Display the wave and asteroid group settings underneath
  each object field button (add some extra spacing)

- Have a yellow outline around the object property field
  that shows if it is not part of this segment?
  

# Create the wave settings and asteroid group interface 
- Add string field that when changed renames its asset file

- Add a button for unparenting it from the segment

- Add a button for deleting the asset


# Create an editor for the AndroidHandler that makes it easy
  to add a new segment to the segment queue
  Will have to specify which folder to save it in?
