// TO DO LIST
===============================================================

# Create a scriptable object for each segment category,
  one for WaveSettings and one for AsteroidSettings
  Then add these to the segment
  
 
# Create a serializable sQueue<T>
- Create a property drawer for the linked list items as
  a reorderable list so I can edit it easily in the inspector


# Create a SegmentHandler that fetches that contains:
- uQueue of SegmentInfos

- IEnumerator Start method for fetching the first segment
  from the uQueue and then do the asteroid spawning
  
  
# Create a SegmentHandler editor that:
- Displays the settings of the assigned segment info
  underneath its object field, so I can edit them directly
  in the segment handler inspector
